Library Management System

This system allows you to Insert, edit, delete, update and search for books as a library management system.

Technologies:
I have used Java, Springboot, React, Bootstrap technologies as well as RESTful API.

Setup:
1. Download the MySQL database I have provided and import it to your server.
2. Change backend database from "Library_manager/src/resources/application.properties" according to your MySQL servver.
3. Debug and Run "Library_manager/src/main/java/com/Library_manager/LibraryManagerApplication"
4. Run (npm start) "Frontend/lib_ms_frontend/src/App.js"

Additional Notes:

All the data is being validated at "Add Book" and "Edit" windows to increase quality of the project.
